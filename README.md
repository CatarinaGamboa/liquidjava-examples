Examples to use with LiquidJava

## Install Visual Studio Code Extension
1. Open the terminal on the extension folder
2. `code --install-extension liquid-java-0.0.1.vsix`
3. Ensure that VSCode has the redhat extension for [Language support for Java â„¢](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) installed and enabled (Java 11 is the minimum required for this extension to run).
4. Open Visual Studio Code and open a Java project (with src folder inside). If the project contains the liquidjava-api.jar then the extension will be activated, otherwise the LiquidJava verification is not applied.
5. The extension may take some time to be activated. While a small wheel in the bottom right of VSCode window is spinning the extension is being loaded.
